This module provides an extended implementation of the IPMI based
initialization vector delivery method supplied by the GenericUW module which
does not rely on MCH sensor data for its polling-based checks but instead makes
direct queries to the cards it services.  This allows it to bypass certain
types of MCH irregularities in sensor recognition, but does not affect failures
in event-based triggering when a card requests reinitialization without
changing M-state.

An example initialization vector table supporting multiple fpgas on multiple
cards in multiple slots is supplied.  When configuration is requested, the
correct record is loaded from this file on-demand and provided to the card.
