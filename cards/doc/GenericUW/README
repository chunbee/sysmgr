This module provides an implementation of the IPMI based initialization vector
delivery method supported by University of Wisconsin MMCs as well as any other
compatible MMC.  This module is designed to accept arbitrary pre-defined
configuration vectors and supply them to multiple types of compatible cards.

An example initialization vector table supporting multiple fpgas on multiple
cards in multiple slots is supplied.  When configuration is requested, the
correct record is loaded from this file on-demand and provided to the card.
