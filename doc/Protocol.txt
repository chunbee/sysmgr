=== BASICS ===

The system manager presents a line-based protocol to access the crate's status
and controls.

In this document -> and <- at the beginning of lines will be used to indicate
commands sent to and from the service, respectively.

Commands consist of whitespace separated text.  "" or '' may be used to supply
multi-word parameters.  Responses will end with a blank line.

Integer fields may be specified either in decimal, or in hexadecmial with the
prefix '0x'.  Both requests and responses may contain either format.  This
draft protocol may standardize on one or the other for responses.

-

All commands sent to the system manager must be prefixed by an even uint32_t.
All replies to this message will be prefixed with the same uint32_t, so they
can be distinguished if multiple commands are processed simultaneously on a
given connection, and so that incoming events are not confused.  All messages
originating from the system manager will be prefixed by an odd uint32_t.  This
will generally be omitted from the examples in this document.  An example of
this would be:

-> 0 AUTHENTICATE "password"
<- 0 PRIVILEGE MANAGE
-> 2 LIST_CRATES
<- 2 1 1 VadaTech
<- 1 EVENT 1 4 "WISC CTP-6" "FPGA Config" 1 4

-

At any time you may recieve
<- 2 ERROR "Message Here"
<- 2
to indicate a failure.

If the error is in response to a command you have sent, the command has
failed.  If the error is not in response to a command you have sent, it may be
fatal to the connection.

The final version of this protocol may include an error number with these
messages.

-

Access to this service is authorized by an optional password, which sets the
level of available access: READ, MANAGE, or RAW.  If you do not authenticate,
you will have access to the highest level availble with a blank password.



=== COMMANDS ===

-> AUTHENTICATE "password"
<- PRIVILEGE {NONE|READ|MANAGE|RAW}

Grants your connection the highest level of access associated with the
supplied password.  Your current privilege level will be returned.

NOTE: Before ever calling AUTHENTICATE, you have the privilege level
equivalent to 'AUTHENTICATE ""'
NOTE: If your privilege level is NONE, any other command (or a number of
failures) will terminate your session.

NOTE: Your privilege will never be downgraded.

-> LIST_CRATES
<- 1 0 VadaTech "Left Crate"
<- 2 1 VadaTech "Right Crate"
<- 3 1 NAT "Spare Crate"

Provides you a list of crates and basic information on each, presently just
the crate number and the MCH type, as configured.

Fields
  Crate Number
  Connected = 1; Not Connected = 0
  MCH Manufacturer
  Description, from the config file.

NOTE: Temporary interruptions can easily happen 'Not Connected' does not mean
'completely offline'.


---


-> LIST_CARDS 1
<- 1 4 "WISC CIOX"
<- 4 4 "WISC CTP-6"
<- 6 4 "WISC CIOX"
<- 7 4 "WISC CIOX"
<- 8 4 "WISC CTP-6"
<- 10 4 "WISC CTP-6"
<- 11 4 "WISC CTP-6"
<- 12 4 "WISC CIOX"
<- 13 4 "BU AMC13"

Returns a list of the cards in a given crate, and basic information on each.
  FRU MState Name

An MState of 255 indicates the hotswap sensor was unreadable.

NOTE: If the specified crate is offline, this data may be stale.


---


-> LIST_SENSORS 1 13
<- "Bottom Temp" T "degrees C" "C"
<- "Top Temp" T "degrees C" "C"
<- "+12V" T "Volts" "V"
<- "+3.3V" T "Volts" "V"
<- "+2.5V" T "Volts" "V"
<- "Pwr Good" D "unspecified" "unspecified"

Returns a list of the sensors available on a given card, and basic information
on each.
  Name ReadingType LongUnitName ShortUnitName

  ReadingType is:
    O OEM
    E Event Only
    T Threshold
    D Discrete


---


-> SENSOR_READ 1 4 "Bottom Temp"
<- RAW 71
<- THRESHOLD 21.750
<- EVENTMASK 0x0000

Fetches and returns the current readings for the given sensor specified by
CrateNo, FRU, SensorName.  If the given Crate/FRU/Name is not unique, any
of the sensors may be read.

If the sensor is not a threshold type, the THRESHOLD response will not be
returned.


---


-> SUBSCRIBE 0xff 0xff "" "" 0x7fff 0x7fff
<- FILTER 1 0xff 0xff "" "" 0x7fff 0x7fff

Subscribes this connection to alerts when matching events occur.

Filter Fields:
  CrateNo
  FRU
  CardName
  SensorName
  AssertionBitmask (Bitmask indicating which offsets' assertions match)
  DeassertionBitmask (Bitmask indicating which offsets' deassertions match)

To match any value, for numeric fields, send 0xff, for string fields send ""

This will return a filter ID.

Once registered, you will spontaneously receive EVENT messages matching your
filters:

<- EVENT 1 2 4 "WISC CTP-6" "FPGA Config" 1 4

Event Fields:
  FilterID
  CrateNo
  FRU
  CardName
  SensorName
  Assertion [0=Deassertion, 1=Assertion]
  Offset

<- FILTER 3 0xff 0xff "WISC CTP-6" "" 0x7fff 0x7fff

Returns a list of all active filters, in the same format as SUBSCRIBE.


---


-> UNSUBSCRIBE 1
<- UNSUBSCRIBED

Removes the event subscription filter with the given ID.

un-readable thresholds.

  Lower Noncritical
  Lower Critical
